# Champions-Costume-Manager
A simple to use, yet powerfull Costume Manager for the MMORPG game, Champions Online. Also has the ability to share your costumes with your friends, using a Share Code, powered by PasteBin.

# STILL Work.In.Progress!

## What works:
- Upload your Costume to PasteBin. (Export)
- Download your costume from Pastebin. (Import)
- Display all your costumes.
- Delete one, or multiple costumes at a time.

## What doesn't work / TODO list:
- Detecting CO folder. Uses a static folder right now. You have to change it yourself, and then compile in order to use it.
- Renaming costumes. This also including renaming the handle, so you can actually use your friends costumes. (Needs testing.)
- Disable costumes without deleting them.
- More??
