# Champions-Costume-Manager
A simple to use, yet powerfull Costume Manager for the MMORPG game, Champions Online. Also has the ability to share your costumes with your friends, using a Share Code, powered by PasteBin.

# STILL Work.In.Progress!
Check the [Releases here](https://github.com/Norway174/Champions-Costume-Manager/releases) if you want to download CCM.
Keep in mind, it's highly BETA right now. And if it breaks, feel free to submit a [ticket](https://github.com/Norway174/Champions-Costume-Manager/issues) in the issues page.

## What works:
- Upload your Costume to PasteBin. (Export)
- Download your costume from Pastebin. (Import)
- Display all your costumes.
- Delete one, or multiple costumes at a time.
- Auto-Detecting CO folder. (As well as the ability to manually add folders)
- Version checker, notifys you of new versions.

## What doesn't work / TODO list:

- Renaming costumes. This also including renaming the handle, so you can actually use your friends costumes. (Needs testing.)
- Disable costumes without deleting them.
- More??
