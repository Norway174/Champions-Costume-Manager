# STILL Work.In.Progress!
## ALPHA:
I've just released a new version, rewitten from scratch up.
This new version will work much better. And I'd greatly appreciate any feedback!

Thank you!

## Download:
Check the [Releases here](https://github.com/Norway174/Champions-Costume-Manager/releases) if you want to download CCM.
Keep in mind, it's highly BETA right now. And if it breaks, feel free to submit a [ticket](https://github.com/Norway174/Champions-Costume-Manager/issues) in the issues page.

## What works:
- Add Multiple folders to move your costumes freely between them.
- Delete one or multiple costumes.
- Easy overview over all your costumes.
- Share your costumes with [Paste.ee](https://paste.ee/).
- Import your own, or your friends costumes from [Paste.ee](https://paste.ee/).

## What doesn't work / TODO list:
- Renaming costumes.
- Displaying costumes with their original in-game name.
- Auto-Update via GitHub. (For now, you have to check back to this page manually.)
- More??
